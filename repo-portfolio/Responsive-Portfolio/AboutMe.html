<h2>About Me</h2>

<img id="mypic" src="assets/images/mypic.jpg"
        
<p>	Hello, and welcome to my webpage. My name is Marame Gattan. I am an Emergency doctor, who is very passionate about her job. One reason why, is because I love to care for everybody, and I love the untraditional working hours and versatality in my practice. I love how it's interprofession and work as a team with a common goal of providing excellent healthcare. I thrive on taking care of the critically ill patients and the geriatric patients.</p>

<p>I am also, a part of the Durham Veterans Affairs (VA) simulation faculty, which is the modern way to teach medical decision making and tasks. It puts the learner at the focus of the training, with the common goal of providing skills, such as excellent care. I thrive on the 'aha' moments that consistently occur during my training. This truly is the best gift you can give a medical educator. Also, it's a way to find system issues prior to system failure.</p>

<p>That's the technical part of my life,  but I am a family person and my family comes first in everything. I am the outgoing person in my family which means I drag everybody to connect with friends. I love to try new things and visit new places and be outdoors but away from spiders and snakes. I am very exciteable, and can never sit still and be in total tranquility. Rarely will I sit down and stay down. </p>
